# ðŸ“š Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll be going over how to create an NFT set on Frame.

Some background knowledge of Solidity is recommended for this guide. By the time we wrap up, you'll have your own NFT set deployed on Frame testnet.

## ðŸ¤” What exactly are NFTs?

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets verified through blockchain technology. When you purchase an NFT, you are acquiring a distinct piece of digital data that is authenticated and stored on a [blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum).

A relatable analogy can be drawn to collecting tangible items such as baseball cards. Each NFT is unique and holds value much like rare collectible cards. While digital files can be copied, owning an NFT provides the certification of owning the original version.

The allure of NFTs largely stems from the sense of ownership they provide. For instance, if you had a photograph taken with a notable figure, the value and sentiment of the photograph would remain unique to you, despite how many copies are made. The photo's originality is preserved by your experience.

Similarly, NFTs retain a singular value due to their originality and proof of ownership. Regardless of how many duplicates are made of a digital artwork, the NFT represents the authenticated original piece. Purchasing an NFT provides a digital certification of ownership, akin to owning a signed original of a piece of artwork, be it digital imagery, video, music, or even social media content. Through NFTs, collectors can verifiably own original digital pieces, establishing a new realm of digital collectibles.

Similarly to other forms of collecting, individuals may be inclined to pay a significant
amount for NFTs. The blockchain technology allows for public visibility of ownership,
serving as a comprehensive, transparent certificate of authenticity. This aspect
of verifiable ownership enhances the appeal and value of NFTs for certain individuals.

It's important to note that this is a nascent field, evolving rapidly. Numerous facets beyond mere ownership display are being explored, one of which being interactivity, which will be discussed in this tutorial.

## ðŸ›  What we're building in this tutorial

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a set of NFTs that you can deploy to the Frame testnet. Since we want to keep this tutorial simple, our NFTs will be pretty basic. They'll have a (unique) name, a description, and a picture.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",

    alignItems: "center",
    marginTop: 20,

}}>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/T6lAzR8.png" style={{ maxWidth: 320, borderRadius: 8  }}></img>
  <p style={{ color: '#888', fontSize: 12, marginTop: 10 }}>You can use any picture you want, but for the sake of this tutorial, we'll be using this one. </p>
</div>
