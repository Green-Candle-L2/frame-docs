# Faucets

Faucets distribute small amounts of testnet Ether to enable developers/users to deploy and interact with contracts on testnets.
Even though testnets do not use mainnet Ether, testnet Ether is still required to pay for transaction fees.

## Sepolia Faucet

Green Candle testnet is built on top of [Sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet) (transactions will settle to Sepolia).
In order to receive Ether on Green Candle, you will need to get Sepolia Ether and bridge it to Green Candle testnet.
