**Frame** is an Ethereum L2 designed to scale NFT adoption across the Ethereum ecosystem. Frame is EVM-equivalent and supports all existing Ethereum tooling, including MetaMask, Foundry, Hardhat and more.

## Why Frame?

NFTs are **first-class citizens on Frame**. Build on Frame and supercharge your smart contracts with safer + scalable NFT operations. Frameâ€™s custom execution client optimizes NFT-centric use cases such as delegation, canonical registry reads + writes, contract account interactions, and more.

As a layer 2, Frame provides cheaper gas fees and faster transaction times while still inheriting many of Ethereum's security guarantees. Your existing EVM smart contracts can be deployed as-is on Frame, no changes are required.

For creators, access an ecosystem where NFTs come first. Royalties are _enforced and simplified_ using [Palette Protocol](https://www.frame.xyz#palette), Frame's enshrined protocol for NFT liquidity.

Frame also gives a portion of sequencer fees to the **Frame Creator Fund**, which we'll reveal more details on later.
