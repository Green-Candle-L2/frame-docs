Green Candle is an Ethereum rollup.

Rollups are a layer 2 scaling solution built on top of Ethereum.
Green Candle is EVM-compatible which means you can do anything on Green Candle that you would be able to do on Ethereum mainnet - deploy contracts, use Web3 apps, interact with wallets, etc.
However, because Green Candle is a rollup, transactions will be cheaper and faster compared to Ethereum.
Green Candle is an Arbitrum rollup which means it inherits many security properties from Ethereum.

## How Rollups Work

The core idea behind a rollup is to move computation from one blockchain (such as Ethereum) onto another blockchain (the rollup) which can process transactions quicker.
Rollups will execute transactions, compress and bundle the transaction data, and post this data back to the underlying blockchain (the layer 1).
This data is utilized by rollup nodes to derive the correct state of the chain, as well as by the Layer 1 network to determine the validity of withdrawals.

Most rollups today have a centralized sequencer that quickly takes incoming transactions, orders the transactions, and publishes the ordering for other nodes to consume.
The sequencer can process transactions quickly, which is why transactions are faster on rollups compared to mainnet (1-2 secs vs 12 secs).
Users can alternatively submit transactions directly to the rollup bridge contract on L1 if they do not trust the sequencer.
However, this process is slower and more expensive than submitting to a sequencer, and should only be used for deposits or in the case of a malicious sequencer.

## Data Availability Committee

Green Candle is an Arbitrum rollup which means it uses "AnyTrust" that manages data availability with a 
permissioned set of parties known as the Data Availability Committee (DAC). This protocol reduces transaction 
fees by introducing an additional trust assumption for data availability in lieu of Ethereum's Trustless data availability mechanism.

## Rollup Tech

Green Candle is built using [Arbitrum's Orbit stack](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction).
Orbit is the latest version of Arbitrum technology which includes a complete rollup system, a sequencer, token bridges, fraud proofs, dac and more.
Complete documentation of Orbit can be found on [Github](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk).
